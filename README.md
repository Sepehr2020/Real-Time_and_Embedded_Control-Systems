Course Desciption: Focuses on implementation and design of embedded computer control systems used in mechatronics and other applications. Many of these systems are real-time in nature, meaning that the computer system must discern the state of the world and react to it within stringent response-time constraints. Upon completion of the course, the student will have a basic understanding of how to design, build and integrate hardware and software for an embedded control application. Hands-on experience will be gained by performing laboratory experiments and doing an embedded computer control project on a mechatronic system.
